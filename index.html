                        <p class="p3" style="font-size: 14px;">I have always worked hard to strive towards perfection , use my resources and skills in the best way possible.I am passionate and focused regarding my activties I do .My code of values, priorities and m first impression have a huge importance in shaping my perspectives and way of living my life  . I always try to live my life courageously without any regrets even if it lands me in a tough situtation still I try to stay calm and improvise in such a way that I get the job done with minimal damages. I really like getting to know people, understanding their perspectives and sometimes trying to embide some of those into myself . I often set my goals and expectations so high that it seems impossible but it is this pursuit of the impossible , adapting to circumstances and constantly worling upon myself which mconstitute my code and help me in becoming a better human being for myself and everyone everyday.       </p>
